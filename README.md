## 👋 Hello World! I’m Alex! 
#### I have always been intrigued with computers since I was a kid. My first piece of hardware was an HC-91 (a Spectrum clone produced in Romania), on which I wrote my first piece of code in BASIC. Following that, I took a Computer Science class in high school and became acquainted with Borland Pascal and C. Those years instilled in me the fundamentals of coding (variable use, loops, and debugging), which have proven to be extremely useful when I start to code again. Even though I did not feel compelled to pursue a career in technology at that moment, instead opting for an Economics major, I eventually realised that I had a different calling. As a result, I began to actively study and practise coding regularly.

#### 👀 My main interest is backend development, with Python and its frameworks - Django & Flask - being my focus right now.

#### 🌱 I’m currently learning Django, after which I will dedicate my learning time to SQL

#### 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that can enhance my learning and comprehension.
