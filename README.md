- 👋 Hello World! I’m Alex! I am a Software Engineer by night, try to escape my full-time day job in Sales. After studying Computer Studies in high school (the ancient languages of Pascal, C and FoxPro), I thought it would be better to pursue a non-technical career. And after two decades, I realised that that was not a great choice and here I am, learning and coding
- 👀 My main interest is backend development, with Python and its frameworks - Django & Flask - being my focus right now.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Django, after which I will dedicate my learning time to SQL
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that can enhance my learning and comprehension.
- 📫 You can reach me here, on Twitter (@alexstanuta) and on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexstanuta/)
